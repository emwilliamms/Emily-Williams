The process of learning coding and circuits can be slow; it is confusing can take time to get used to it, to get moving.

Along with familiarizing myself with Arduino, I explored the creative computing pathway by linking these circuits to liquid motion. 

The idea of the flowing current within a circuit, plus the process for electricity, to power, to light - it's fluid. Hydropower uses the natural flow of moving water to generate electricity... for me, this notion is symbolised the flow of a waterdroplet or a bubble, whilst the colours connote the theory of light and whatb it is.
