# Creative Computing Process
###### Emily Williams



The process of learning coding and circuits can be slow; it is confusing can take time to get used to it, to get moving.

Along with familiarizing myself with Arduino, I explored the creative computing pathway by linking these circuits to liquid motion. The idea of the flowing current within a circuit, plus the process for electricity, to power, to light - it's *fluid*.  

**Hydropower** uses the natural flow of moving water to generate electricity... for me, this notion is symbolised the flow of a waterdroplet or a bubble, whilst the colours connote the theory of light and what it is. 

Creative computing is a huge field. I learnt that you just have to keep experimenting until you get an outcome you're happy with, or something you can at least talk about. I found it helped doing things in steps, working my way up to the more complex platforms, and even though I already had some slight experience with After Effects, my idea meant I had to try completing different techniques/tools. I am happy with my outcome, but I also know I could make improvements and push my idea further.


## Process / Research

**Yang Cook**

Cook is a graphic designer, from Kiev, Ukraine, whose work can be described as 'Abstract Art & Techno'. Many of his designs symbolise water or liquids, with colours being used in many to emphasise this soap or even oil effect.

In relation to my project, I found this linked to hydropower as well as electricty, and with this sort of digital art being my focus, I decided to research his work/style.


**Gleb Kuznetsov**

I also further explored designers who worked with motion graphics, specifically looking for those with liquid. motion details. I wanted to find the flow of the images, in which I could translate into my final outcome.

I wanted to work with a cirlcular design due to my concept of a bubble or droplet, so also looked what animations could be made with them as a focus point.

## Outcome

Using After Effects, I matched the background to the one of the circle colours in order to make more of a bubble style, then used a distort feature to create the movement. A next step would be to perhaps add more shapes that would become incorporated into the main shape, making it increase in size throughout the animation, or to maybe have it moving across the screen. 

Another feature I considered changing were the colours so that it looked more realistic in terms of water.. however, I decided against this as I also wanted connotaions to the colours of lights, hence the use of various colours.

I also experiemnted with a black background to see if would make the circle. stand out more but found it wasn't as effective as the coloured version.

Finally, when uploading to padlet, I had to compress the file size to a much lower quality in order for it to be small enough...

## Reflection
I initially thought that I wouldn’t like this week's project as I generally don't really enjoy coding, which I thought was what we would be doing. Despite this, I approached it with an open mind and ended up liking it. It’s a lot less about the computer coding and much more about using these elements combined with creative computing overall, leading to why I chose to explore this area of design, and go back to Adobe After Effects to create my final outcome. Throughout my research, I have developed an even keener interest in Creative Computing.
