# Creative Computing Process
###### Emily Williams



The process of learning coding and circuits can be slow; it is confusing can take time to get used to it, to get moving.

Along with familiarizing myself with Arduino, I explored the creative computing pathway by linking these circuits to liquid motion. 

The idea of the flowing current within a circuit, plus the process for electricity, to power, to light - it's *fluid*.   Hydropower uses the natural flow of moving water to generate electricity... for me, this notion is symbolised the flow of a waterdroplet or a bubble, whilst the colours connote the theory of light and what it is. 

Creative computing is a huge field. I learnt that you just have to keep experimenting until you get an outcome you're happy with, or something you can at least talk about. I found it helped doing things in steps, working my way up to the more complex platforms, and even though I already had some slight experience with After Effects, my idea meant I had to try completing different techniques/tools. I am happy with my outcome, but I also know I could make improvements and push my idea further.
